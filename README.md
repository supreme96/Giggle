#Giggle 	

Giggle is an Android application that I created to learn the creation of Java and Android Libraries using Gradle as well as use the of a Google Cloud Endpoints module. Paid(without Ads) and free flavors(with test Ads) of the application were also created. Signed APKS of both the version are included in this repo.   <br />
<br />
To run the application : <br/>
1.First start the local server named as backend from Android Studio.
2.Then start either of the paid or free flavors of the app. <br/>
